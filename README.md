Comments on solution code:
Raine's solution created a new div for appointment info on a separate line while
our solution created a new div 'on top' of our existing appointment div
and then replaced it. 

Raine's JS code was clearly defined with three sections:
variable initialization, function declarations, and event handlers.

Raine's solution also included a JS Utility file including supplant and pad.

Interesting how supplant was used to change the 'tint' of the rgb value of the date.

Both of our solutions had similar scroll functions.

Nice use of 'esc' keypress to exit appointment message area if no message is desired.
Our solution would close the Message field once user clicked outside the field.
